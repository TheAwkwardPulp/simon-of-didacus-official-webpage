            <p>
                This paper was written early on in my formal studies.  As such, 
                the portion on "Last Generation Theology" was written with very 
                little knowledge of what the string of doctrines actually proposes.
                While I stand by what has been written in context with the rest of 
                the paper, I do not now claim to be a "Last Generation Theologian".  
                I will, however, encourage you to search Scripture for what God has 
                to say about the ideas these doctrines propose.  May God bless you 
                with a deeper knowledge of Him.
            </p>
